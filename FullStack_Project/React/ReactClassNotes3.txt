useRef

useRef is a hook in React that allows you to create a reference to a DOM element or a component instance. 
It can be used to access or manipulate the underlying DOM node or component instance directly, rather than going through the component's state and props. 
The useRef hook returns an object with a single property, current, which initially is null. 
You can then set the current property to a DOM element or component instance, and it will persist across re-renders of the component.


const obj1 = { name: "Sunny"};
const obj2 = { name: "Roshan"};
const obj3 = { name: "Sunny"};

console.log(obj1 === obj3) // this returns false because obj1 and obj3 store the value to the reference of the object rather than the object itself.
console.log(obj1 === obj2) // this returns false
