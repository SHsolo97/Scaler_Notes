    border: sets the border of an element.
    padding: sets the space between an element's content and its border.
    margin: sets the space outside an element's border.

    width: sets the width of an element.
    height: sets the height of an element.
    float: sets whether an element should float to the left or right of its container.
    position: sets the positioning method of an element (static, relative, absolute, or fixed).
    top, bottom, left, and right: sets the position of an element based on its position property.
    text-decoration: sets the decoration of the text (underline, overline, line-through, etc.).
    text-transform: sets the capitalization of the text (uppercase, lowercase, capitalize).
    line-height: sets the space between lines of text.
    letter-spacing: sets the space between characters in the text.

    text-shadow: adds a shadow effect to the text.
    box-shadow: adds a shadow effect to the element's box.
    background-image: sets the background image of an element.
    background-position: sets the position of the background image.
    background-size: sets the size of the background image.
    background-repeat: sets how the background image should be repeated.
    border-radius: sets the curvature of the element's border.
    opacity: sets the opacity level of an element.
    transition: sets the transition effect between two states of an element.
    transform: applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element.

Specificity rule :
    pref(important) > pref(id)(100) > pref(class)(10) > pref(element)(1)

display : block vs inline vs inline-block
    block takes up the space within the entire row.
    Inline takes up only enough space to display content inside the inline without accounting for width and height properties.
    inline-block takes up space according to conent inside the inline block but also accounts for width and height properties.
